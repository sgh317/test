/**
 * This interface represents the functionality to convert a JSON representation to/from a
 * Java representation. The serializer's goal is to preserve as much Java structure as
 * possible: primitive types, arrays, object clusters containing recursive references and so on.
 * As a consequence, the generated JSON is rather terse. The serializer is the best choice in a
 * Java centric application where you want to write some object structures to JSON in a readable form.
 * If the emphasis is on clean JSON, take a look at the Mapper tool, which does not support all Java constructs
 * but which emits nice JSON which can easily be parsed in e.g. Javascript.
 *
 * * The main difference between the serializer and the mapper is that the serializer keeps as much
 * type information and structure information in the JSON data where the mapper uses the type information
 * in the provided Java classes to interprete the JSON data.
